### **texpack**

Simple cross-platform command line texture packer based on the MaxRects packing algorithm by Jukka Jyl√§nki (https://github.com/juj/RectangleBinPack).

**Usage:**

```
Usage: texpack -o <output-files-prefix> [options...] [<input-file>]

The <input-file> should contain a list of image files (png) separated by new
lines. If no <input-file> is given, it will read from stdin.

Options:

-h, --help            Show this help.
-o, --output          Prefix for the generated files (atlas and json).
-p, --padding         Padding between sprites.
-s, --size            Fixed size for the atlas image (i.e. 512x512).
-S, --max-size        Max size for the atlas image (ignored if size is used).
-P, --POT             Keep atlas size a power of two (ignored if size is used).
-r, --allow-rotate    Allows sprites to be rotated for better packing.
-m, --metadata        Input metadata file in json format. (*)
-e, --pretty          Generated json file will be human readable.
-i, --indentation     Number of spaces for indentation, 0 to use tabs (default).
-b, --alpha-bleeding  Post-process atlas image with an alpha bleeding algorithm.
-M, --mode            Specifies the packing heuristic. Allowed values are:
                        * auto (default; tries all modes and selects one)
                        * bottom-left
                        * short-side
                        * long-side
                        * best-area
                        * contact-point

(*) The format of the metadata file should be as follows:

    {
      "someimage.png":    {"param1": "some-value", "param2": 0, ...},
      "anotherimage.png": "not necessarily an object",
      ...
    }

    Each file name should match one in the <input-file> list.
```

**Output:**

At least one image (the texture atlas) and its corresponding json file will be generated. If the sprites don't fit in the atlas (when using --size or --max-size), a set of images with its json file will be generated.

The generated json file will have a format like this:

```javascript
{
    "width": 512,              // texture atlas width
    "height": 512,             // texture atlas height

    "sprites": {
        "image1.png": {
            "x": 0,            // coords of sprite rect in atlas
            "y": 0,

            "width": 60,       // size of sprite rect in atlas
            "height": 100,

            "rotated": true,   // whether sprite is rotated or not (clockwise)
                               // available if used --allow-rotate

            "meta": /*...*/    // sprite metadata; available if --metadata
                               // is given and it has data for the sprite
        },
        //...
    }
}
```

**Example:**

This will take all PNG's in the current directory and generate the texture atlas in the out/ directory.

```bash
find . -name "*.png" | texpack -o out/atlas
```

**Building:**

Building has been tested on Linux, OSX and Windows (with MSYS/mingw-w64). Visual Studio is not supported.

In order to build, you will need to make sure that `libpng` and `zlib` are installed on your system. On Linux, you can use your system package manager to install these libraries. For example:

```bash
# Arch Linux
sudo pacman -S libpng

# Ubuntu
# sudo apt-get install libpng12-dev  # libpng 1.2 will not work
```

`zlib` is a `libpng` dependency so it should be installed along with it.

Once you have that just run `make` on the texpack project directory. If the libraries aren't installed on the default compiler paths, you can use `CFLAGS` and `LDFLAGS` to give it the required paths. For example, if the libraries were located inside `~/libs`:

```bash
export CFLAGS=-I~/libs/include
export LDFLAGS=-L~/libs/lib
make
```

The resulting binary file will be inside the `bin/` directory.

If you don't have a package manager you may have to download and compile both `zlib` and `libpng` yourself. Here's an example of how you could do this (do not just copy paste this):

```bash
# go to project directory
cd texpack

# create a directory for the libraries and move in there
mkdir ext
cd ext

# download required files
curl -L -O http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/libpng/libpng-1.6.14.tar.gz?download
curl -L -O http://zlib.net/zlib-1.2.8.tar.gz

# extract them
tar xf libpng*
tar xf zlib*

# compile and install zlib
cd zlib*
./configure --prefix=`pwd`/..
make
make install
cd ..

# note: that won't work on MSYS (windows). you can do this instead:
cd zlib*
export BINARY_PATH="`pwd`/../bin"
export INCLUDE_PATH="`pwd`/../include"
export LIBRARY_PATH="`pwd`/../lib"
make -f win32/Makefile.gcc
make -f win32/Makefile.gcc install
cd ..

# compile and install libpng
cd libpng*
./configure --prefix=`pwd`/.. --with-zlib-prefix=`pwd`/..
make
make install
cd ..

# get back to the texpack directory and compile it
cd ..
export CFLAGS=-I`pwd`/ext/include
export LDFLAGS=-L`pwd`/ext/lib
make
```
